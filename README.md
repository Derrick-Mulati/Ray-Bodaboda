* Engine sizes of 125cc and 150cc are the most prevalent among the motorcycles.

* The majority of respondents own their bikes rather than leasing them.

* The cost of motorcycles varies, with the most common prices falling in the range of 130,000 to 160,000.

* A significant number of respondents did not provide any deposit for their bikes, while others gave deposits ranging from 15,000 to 50,000.

* The majority of respondents did not use any financial institution for their motorcycle loans, with a significant portion relying on friends or family for financing.


* Daily instalments were the most common payment cycle, followed by weekly and monthly.

* The daily income of respondents varies, with the most common range being 1,000 to 2,000.

* Respondents typically cover a range of 50 to 100 kilometers per day and consume 3 to 4 liters of fuel daily.

* The majority of respondents do not have insurance, while those who do spend around 3,000 to 3,500 on insurance.


* Bikes are commonly parked at home, but there are various other locations mentioned as well.

## Recommendations:

* Since the most common age range of respondents is between 22 and 34, targeting this demographic with marketing and promotional activities can be effective in attracting more customers.

* Considering the popularity of Boxer and TVS motorcycle brands, it would be beneficial for dealerships and manufacturers to ensure an adequate supply of these models to meet the demand.

* Providing financing options and loans directly through dealerships can be a viable alternative for those who do not have access to traditional financial institutions.

* Educating customers about the benefits of insurance and offering affordable insurance plans can help increase the number of insured riders.

* Promoting the use of online taxi services among respondents who are not registered can open up additional income opportunities for them.
Offering regular maintenance packages and promoting the importance of routine maintenance can help prolong the lifespan of bikes and reduce repair costs for customers.
* Collaborating with fuel companies or offering fuel discounts to customers can be an attractive incentive for riders.

* Improving parking facilities and security in popular parking locations can provide peace of mind to riders and reduce the risk of theft or damage to their bikes.

These recommendations are based on the provided data, and it is important to conduct further market research and analysis to tailor strategies and initiatives according to the specific needs and preferences of the target audience.
